      <h1>Quotes That Make Me Think</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">“Words that stir the mind, ignite the spirit, and sharpen the vision.”</p>

      <div class="quote">
        “If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. 
        It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. 
        It could mean mockery–isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. 
        And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. 
        If you’re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. 
        You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. 
        You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It’s the only good fight there is.”
        <div class="author">— Charles Bukowski</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.”
        <div class="author">— Confucius</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “You have to be willing to look like a fool for what you believe in, because the world won’t understand vision until it manifests.”
        <div class="author">— Unknown</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but by all means, keep moving.”
        <div class="author">— Martin Luther King Jr.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “Success is not for the chosen few. It’s for the few who choose to remain consistent, disciplined, and resilient long after excitement fades.”
        <div class="author">— Anonymous</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”
        <div class="author">— Steve Jobs</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
        The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, 
        who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; 
        who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
        and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.”
        <div class="author">— Theodore Roosevelt</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “When you want something so badly that you’re willing to lose sleep, friends, comfort, and routine for it; that’s when the universe takes you seriously.”
        <div class="author">— Unknown</div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        “One day, all the late nights, the doubt, and the hard choices will make sense. 
        Keep going you’re building something eternal within yourself.”
