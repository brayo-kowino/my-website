    <!-- Biography Text -->
    <div class="bio-container text-[1rem] fade-in">

      <p>I was born in <strong class="highlight">Nakuru County</strong> and raised by my great-grandma in a small village in <strong class="highlight">Siaya County, Kenya</strong> a land of rich food, calm villages, resilient people, and stories that breathe inspiration. From my earliest days, I carried a deep curiosity that reached beyond play. I wasn’t just fascinated by things; I wanted to understand how they worked. Radios, chargers, phones if it had wires, it became my next experiment.</p>

      <p>In <strong>primary school</strong>, my curiosity found direction. I became known as the boy who could “fix things.” My teachers noticed my patience and analytical mind. They trusted me with school gadgets, a rare privilege. I was appointed <strong class="highlight">Secretary ICT</strong>, managing school computers, projectors and ensuring smooth digital lessons. I performed these duties with discipline and excellence, earning an official certification of recognition that remains one of my proudest early milestones.</p>

      <p>As I transitioned into <strong?>St. Paul's Ndenga Secondary School</strong>, leadership and discipline became defining parts of my life. I served as <strong>Class Captain</strong> and later as <strong>Secretary of the Disciplinary Committee</strong>. Leadership was not about being feared; it was about being fair, listening, and guiding others. Through this, I earned trust not just from teachers, but from fellow students who saw me as dependable and just.</p>

      <p>Academically, I was very good. My strength lay in <strong>Mathematics, Computer Studies, Geography, Chemistry, and Biology</strong>. I had a special love for Computer Studies, where I consistently ranked top of my class with plain <strong>A</strong>. Physics, though challenging, never discouraged me it made me more determined to understand the science behind technology.</p>

      <p>Then came the <strong class="highlight">KCSE results</strong>. I was the overral top performer of my school. My <strong>A in Biology</strong> surprised even my teachers. Everyone expected me to pursue Medicine; “You’re meant to be a doctor,” they said. But my heart had already chosen its path. I didn’t want to heal bodies; I wanted to build systems that empower minds. So I ignored Medicine entirely and set my eyes on technology.</p>

      <p>I applied for <strong>Computer Science at the University of Nairobi</strong> and <strong>Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering at JKUAT</strong>. Fate had a different plan; I was placed in Mining Engineering. At first, disappointment hit me. But my father, who always called me “Engineer,” smiled and said, “This is your destiny.” Today, I see how right he was because engineering became the bridge that united my technical curiosity with real-world application.</p>

      <p>At <strong>JKUAT</strong>, I continued to rise not just as a student, but as a leader. I was elected <strong>Class Representative</strong> and later <strong>Secretary General of the Mining Engineers Society of Kenya</strong>. These roles taught me diplomacy, patience, and strategy; qualities every true leader must master. People trusted me because I listened, acted with integrity, and always delivered. I became known as the person who worked quietly but left an undeniable impact.</p>

      <p>Parallel to my academic journey, I deepened my love for computers. Through <strong>YouTube, online courses, and late-night coding sessions as well as programming units that were part of my course.</strong>, I taught myself programming. From <strong>C and C++</strong> to <strong>Java and Web Systems</strong>, I built the skills that now define my second career. I started developing real solutions note apps, communication platforms, student management tools, designing and modelling using CAD softwares each one born from a problem I experienced myself.</p>

      <p>This journey led me to found <strong class="highlight">Iskify360™</strong> a digital ecosystem designed to merge education, innovation, and productivity. As its <strong>Founder and CEO</strong>, I envision Iskify360 as a transformative platform connecting students, professionals, and innovators under one intelligent system. It is more than an app; it’s my contribution to the next generation of African innovators.</p>

      <p>Throughout my life, education and leadership, I’ve been described as <strong>disciplined, reliable, and focused</strong>. I’ve never led for the spotlight, I lead for impact. My hardwork, humility and persistence earned me the <strong>Best School Overall KCSE Student 2022, Most Disciplined Student Award</strong> and the <strong>Best Performing Executive Award</strong>. These honors reflect the same principles I live by: consistency, honesty, and service.</p>

      <p>Beyond my professional life, I remain deeply connected to <strong>nature and exploration</strong>. I often take long walks with my girlfriend because well I'm also a very good lover, observing landscapes and drawing inspiration from the balance of natural systems. This grounding perspective fuels my creativity and drives my pursuit of sustainable innovation in both mining and software development.</p>

      <p>Today, I stand as both an <strong>Engineer and Developer</strong> merging technology and engineering to redefine modern solutions. My dream is to use tech to optimize mineral exploration and empower communities in Siaya and across Kenya. I believe Africa doesn’t lack potential it lacks opportunity, and that’s what I’m here to change.</p>

      <p>My story is far from over. I continue to learn, to innovate, and to grow guided by one unshakable belief: that excellence is not a destination but a continuous journey.</p>

      <p class="text-indigo-700 italic text-center mt-10 text-lg font-medium">
        “I’m not here to fit in. I’m here to build something that will outlive my name.”<br>
