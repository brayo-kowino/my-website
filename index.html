                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>Hello! I am Engineer Brian Odhiambo, a professional skilled in <strong>Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering</strong> and <strong>Software Development</strong>. With experience in <strong>C, C++ and Java programming</strong>, I focus on <strong>Android and web development</strong>, creating solutions that improve productivity and make life easier for users.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>My journey into leadership and technology began early. In primary school, I served as the <strong>Secretary ICT</strong>, a role that showcased my early love for computers and the immense trust my teachers had in me. I was entrusted with institutional devices and computers to manage, a responsibility I upheld with dedication. As recognition of my contribution, I received a certification from the institution, which I proudly hold to this day.</p>

                         <div class="extra-content hidden">
                    
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>In high school, I took on various leadership roles, including serving as the <strong>Class Captain</strong> and the <strong>Secretary of the Disciplinary Committee</strong>. These roles allowed me to develop strong leadership and organizational skills early on. Currently, I am the <strong>Class Representative</strong> and the <strong>Secretary General of the Mining Engineers Society of Kenya</strong> at JKUAT. My extensive leadership experience enables me to promote teamwork, support my peers, and drive innovation in both academic and professional settings.</p>
                    </div>
                     
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>As the founder and CEO of <strong>Iskify360</strong>, I aim to merge technology with real-world applications. The platform empowers users to manage their academic and professional lives while staying updated with cutting-edge tools and solutions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>My journey into technology started early. As a child, I loved electronic gadgets and even attempted repairs while in primary school. In high school, I was fortunate that the school offered Computer Studies, and I took it as one of my subjects. I excelled in Computer Studies, Mathematics, Geography, Biology, and Chemistry—though I was average in Physics because, well, handling Mathematics and all these sciences wasn’t easy! [Haha!] Despite that, I emerged as the top performer in my KCSE examinations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>I applied for Computer Science at the University of Nairobi because, naturally, I’m a "computer person." I also applied for Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering at JKUAT. Even though my A in Biology could guarantee me a medicine course, I chose to ignore it. Ironically, my dad would call me "engineer" every time in high school, but I wanted to be called a computer guru instead! When placement results came, I was surprised to see Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering at JKUAT. Although I wasn’t initially happy, my parents encouraged me to pursue it. Now, I’m deeply engaged in this engineering field while also growing as a software developer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>While pursuing my degree, I also studied <strong>computer programming units</strong> as part of the curriculum. These units significantly boosted my knowledge and skills in software development, giving me a deeper understanding of coding and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>I come from a region where mining activities are so limited that people often told me to "just be prepared; after finishing your degree, you'll go back home and farm." It’s true—my home county is Siaya, but thankfully, I had incredibly supportive parents and a remarkable advisor, my then chemistry teacher, who encouraged me to forget what people were saying and focus on what I’ve been called to do. That advice changed my perspective entirely.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>Now, with my engineering expertise and passion for technology, I am willing to integrate, explore, and develop better ways of utilizing technology to open new avenues for mineral exploration in my home county. Minerals are undoubtedly present in Siaya, and I am determined to contribute to unlocking their potential while also creating opportunities for my community.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>About software development—this has been a personal journey. I began teaching myself through YouTube, online resources, and even revisited my high school notes because, let’s face it, learning is wide! Currently, I’m working on obtaining a software development certification, whether online or from an educational facility.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>Beyond my work, I enjoy exploring nature and the environment, which inspires me to seek sustainable solutions in both engineering and software projects. This connection to nature keeps me grounded and creative.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>Some of my key achievements include being recognized as the <strong>Most Disciplined Student</strong> and receiving the <strong>Best Performing Executive Award</strong>. These accolades reflect my dedication and drive to excel in all aspects of my career.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-in">
                        <p>My long-term vision is to advance technology in mining, education, and beyond, creating innovative solutions that make a difference in society. I am always open to learning new technologies and exploring how they can be used to transform our world.</p>
